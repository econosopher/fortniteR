Description: An R client for accessing the Fortnite Ecosystem API, allowing users
    to retrieve island metadata and engagement metrics. The package provides functions
    to search for Fortnite Creative islands, retrieve detailed metadata about specific
    islands including titles, descriptions, and tags, and access engagement metrics
    such as daily active users and play duration. It supports pagination for large
    result sets and time-series analysis of island performance. The API endpoint is
    <https://api.fortnite.com/ecosystem/v1>.
