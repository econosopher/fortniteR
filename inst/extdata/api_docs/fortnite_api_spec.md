# Fortnite Ecosystem API v1.0.0

## Overview

<b>A public API to retrieve a list of Fortnite islands and their corresponding engagement metrics.</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Usage Notes / Limitations:
* Historical data is limited to 7 days
* Only data for public and discoverable Fortnite islands are available.
* Islands need at least 5 unique players for the specified time interval for data to appearâ€”otherwise, you'll get a null value.
* Favorites and recommendations are not supported for some Epic-made games, so these fields will return 0.
